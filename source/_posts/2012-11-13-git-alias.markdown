Following are some of the common git aliases, people use. Add them to ~/.bash_profile

```
alias g='git'
alias gst='git status'
alias gs='git push'
alias gc='git commit'
alias gca='git commit -a'
alias ga='git add'
alias gco='git checkout'
alias gb='git branch'
alias gm='git merge'
alias gd="git diff"
```


An additional syntax highlighting can be provided as well with the following:

```
export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=gxfxaxdxcxegedabagacad
```
